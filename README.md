As at 24 August 2023, I'm learning Python through undertaking a 100-day Python learning challenge with a mentor. 

**Day 1 HELLO WORLD Project**

Hello, World!

It was an exercise in ... 

1) finding the right path ... this was the BIGGEST challenge ... kinda never really paid attention to these until today
2) having to request **whoami** as I didn't know my user name
3) Having changed the folder name 3 times before "VSC_Python" iteration I did not realise that I needed to go back to the Visual Code editor and re-save the file.

   Happy to have a AI agent guide me through the process to get started.
